|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 7.0 CHANGES: enhancements                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

Voyager 7.2 compatibility
-------------------------
Minor tweaks to work with Tomcat 7.2 changes.

Voyager 7.0 compatibility
-------------------------
Integrates functionally into the Voyager 7.0 server-side 
WebVoyage tomcat architecture.  Implements the look and feel 
and functionality of the new WebVoyage user interface. 

Book cover thumbnails
---------------------
Can enable Google or Syndetic Solutions book cover thumbnail
images.  Thumbnail image is linked to the respective service.
This enhancement is still in 'beta' development.

Google-like keyword search
--------------------------
Words are automatically boolean ANDed.  Words in quotes are
searched as a phrase.

Unicode-aware keyword searching 
-----------------------------
Search terms containing UTF-8 encoded diacritics are handled
correctly.

Keyword search truncation
-------------------------
Ending truncation with an * or a ?.

Search term highlighting
------------------------
Search terms are highlighted in the results pages.


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 6.1.2 CHANGES: enhancement                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

Utility revision
----------------
The utility of discovering the Oracle-Perl environment has
been revised and renamed "dope.sh".


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 6.1.1 CHANGES: fix and enhancement                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

Path to Perl
------------
Changed the path to Perl on the top line of the scripts to
point to a version of Perl that is being installed by 
Endeavor during the Voyager with Unicode upgrade.  This Perl
version has new DBI and DBD::Oracle modules that are 
compatible with the upgraded Voyager Oracle version. 

Utility for determining Perl versions and DBI/DBD modules
---------------------------------------------------------
Included a utility ("versions.sh") that can be run from the 
command line.  The script attempts to determine how many 
copies of Perl are installed on the system, what versions 
they are, and which ones have the DBI & DBD::Oracle modules.
 

|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 6.1 CHANGES: enhancement                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

Canned link via bib_id
----------------------
The link-back to the WebVoyage record from the New Books List
result pages is now accomplished via the bib ID redirect that
was enabled as part of the Voyager with Unicode release (and
that was actually implemented at some point for 2001.2). This
enhancement solves the problems inherent in linking back by 
title for the items that lacked an ISBN number. 


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 6.0 CHANGES: enhancement                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

Unicode compatability (enhancement)
---------------------
This version of the New Books List has been designed for
compatibility with the Voyager Unicode release:
1) Files containing text to be output as HTML source code have 
   been UTF-8 encoded.
2) Data extracted from Voyager by newbooks.pl will no longer
   need to undergo any character conversion.
3) HTML pages generated by newbooks.cgi now include meta tags
   that explicitely declare the UTF-8 character set.


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 5.0.6 CHANGES: new feature                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

Browser compatibility tweaking (improvement)
------------------------------
Made some minor tweaks to HTML code for uniformity of display
in different browsers. 


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 5.0.5 CHANGES: new feature                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

Explicit declaration of character set (improvement)
-------------------------------------
New Books List HTML pages now specify, via a META tag, that 
text is encoded in the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) character.


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 5.0.4 CHANGES: new feature                         |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

New language module for Welsh (new feature)
-----------------------------

Thanks to the University of Wales Aberystwyth, there is now
a newbooks.Welsh language module.  A minor change was made
to newbooks.cgi to better accommodate Welsh syntax.
 

|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 5.0.3 CHANGES: bug fixes                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

URL encoding for email submission   (bug fix)
---------------------------------

If location fragment strings contained spaces, it could 
result in problems if an end user limited a search by that 
location, the results exceeded the records-per-page, and 
the end-user then attempted to email records.


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 5.0.2 CHANGES: improvements                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

Windows 2000 version  (improvement)
--------------------

There is now a Windows 2000 version of the distribution.


ISBN vetting (improvement)
------------

The newbooks.cgi script does a more accurate vetting of ISBN
values for the canned search link-back to WebVoyage.


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 5.0.1 CHANGES: bug fixes                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------|

URL quotation marks
-------------------

Voyager title searches that contained quotes were failing with 
the error message, "System could not interpret your search."
The newbooks.cgi program now removes quotation marks in the 
title portion of the link-back URL, for those items without 
ISBN numbers.


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 5.0 CHANGES: new features, improvements, bug fixes |
|------------------------------------------------------------|


Choice of language(s) for user interface (new feature)
----------------------------------------

Sites can choose a monolingual interface, or can select from
available language modules to provide a multilingual interface 
that allows the end-user to select the desired language.  A 
language module template makes it easy for a site to add any 
additional languages to those included with the distribution.

Easier upgrades (improvement)
---------------

All configuration has been moved out of newbooks.cgi and put
into the newbooks.ini file and language modules.  Separating
out these parts should make upgrading easier.

SQL "pass 3" option (improvement)
-------------------

The newbooks.pl program allows for the optional capture of 
bib records with an 856, but sans an item record.  Many
libraries will not want to use this, but it is available 
for those that don't maintain 856 data in the mfhd record.  

Form method changes (improvement)
-------------------

All form "post" methods were converted to "get".  Including
the query string in all calls to the newbooks.cgi program,  
(other than the initial call) means that entries in the web
server logs can potentially contain more useful data.


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 4.0.2 CHANGES: HTML code cleanup                   |
|------------------------------------------------------------|


Hard-coded "week" (bug fix)
-----------------

An instance of the word "week" that was hard-coded into 
newbooks.cgi was replaced with the appropriate variable.


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 4.0.1 CHANGES: HTML code cleanup                   |
|------------------------------------------------------------|


Compatibility with Internet Explorer 6.0
----------------------------------------

The HTML code was tweaked so that pages look OK when viewed 
with the IE6 browser.  This mainly had to do with how IE6 
rendered table cell content when the table was placed
within a div element that had an align="center" attribute.

HTML code cleanup
-----------------

A few minor code modifications were made to more closely
conform to the HTML 4.0 Document Type Definition (DTD).


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 4.0 CHANGES: new features, improvements, bug fixes |
|------------------------------------------------------------|


New, improved SQL query (improvement)
-----------------------

The definition of "what constitutes a new item" (as embodied 
within the logic of the SQL query) has been totally revamped. 
Now, new electronic-only items (e.g. eBooks) are included along 
with the new physical items (i.e. things with an item record).
Physical items are defined as "new" if they have both an item
create date AND either a mfhd create date or mfhd update date 
within the desired time span; new electronic items are defined
as "new" if they have a mfhd create date within the desired 
time span. (Alan Manifold contributed to the physical item 
definition, but any errors in logic or execution are my own.) 

The new electronic-only items display a web link to the
resource.  Physical items that include a URL within the
bibliographic record also display a web link.

Items that have OPAC suppression at the bib level will not be 
retrieved by newbooks.pl.  Previously, only items with OPAC
suppression at the holdings level were ignored.  Thanks to
Paul McClay for alerting me to this oversight.

Location information is now drawn from the item table (rather
than the mfhd_master table), which is more accurate.  Thanks
to Alan Manifold for his insight on this.


Weeks or months option (new feature)
----------------------

It is now possible to retrieve (and display) 4 months 
of items instead of 4 weeks.  This is a sysadmin option at
the time of setting up the program, not an on-the-fly  patron 
option.  Although the New Books List was not conceived to be
archival in nature, many of the libraries using the program 
either modified the code to include larger time periods or 
asked for that enhancement. 


Lag time choice (new feature)
---------------

The "lag time" built into the date criteria of the SQL query 
exists so that your library's technical services dept has some 
time to actually catalog an item (and hopefully get it on the 
shelf) before it is picked up by the new books list.  For 
some libraries, the previous default lag time of one week 
resulted in a large number of items showing up as "In Process".  
The newbooks.pl program can now be configured to allow either 
one week or two weeks of lag time.


More records-per-page choices (improvement)
-----------------------------

With some libraries choosing to extract a database of 4 months 
(rather than weeks) of items, it was thought that the addition 
of a 100 records per page choice might be useful when it came
time to display the records.


Short or long title choice (new feature)
--------------------------

There is now the option of displaying either the short title
(the 245 field up to the slash), or the long title (the full
245 field). 


Temp locations display (new feature)
----------------------

If an item has a temporary location assigned, the temporary 
location will display below the permanent location.


Publisher info display (new feature)
----------------------

At time of configuration, the option exists to display
imprint information (publication place, publisher, and
date of publication) below the title in the results
display.


WebVoyage-style pagination (new feature)
--------------------------

Large results sets now have WebVoyage-style pagination.  
This allows intermediate jumps forward and backward by the 
"records-per-page" interval, for up to 5 jumps forward and
2 jumps backward, as well jumps to the first and last page.

This new pagination can also be color-coordinated similar
to the WebVoyage default appearance (or the color coordination
can be turned off - my preference!).


"No third tab" option (new feature)
---------------------

Some libraries do not utilize the third tab of the WebVoyage
search screen (i.e. Course Reserves).  Displaying the third
tab of the initial New Books List form is now optional via
a configuration variable.


Date format change (internationalization)
------------------

The format of dates included in the Save/Print/Email output 
has been changed from mm/dd/yyyy to Month dd, yyyy to avoid 
confusion between US and European date conventions.

 
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 3.3 CHANGES: new features, improvements, bug fixes |
|------------------------------------------------------------|


Diacritics display (new feature)
------------------

MARC data extracted from Voyager by newbooks.pl is converted 
into the Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) character set.  Latin-1 is the 
base character set for Unicode.  For American, British, 
Australian, and New Zealand sites, conversion is from the 
MARC-8 character set used in MARC 21 records.  Finnish sites 
have the option of converting from MARC21-fin or FINMARC 
character sets (modified MARC-8 and ISO-6937/2, respectively). 

Minor changes were made to newbooks.cgi in order to accommodate
keyword searching in a "diacritics-rich" environment.


Link back via ISBN (improvement)
------------------
The "definition" of an ISBN number was expanded to allow for
dashes ("-").  This is apparently common in non-USMARC records
and helps "internationalize" the New Books List.


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 3.2 CHANGES: new features, improvements, bug fixes |
|------------------------------------------------------------|


Ubiquitous "New Books" Tabs (new feature)
---------------------------

It is now possible to have the "New Books" tab appear on all
of the WebVoyage search screens.  This involves editing the 
opac.ini file rather than any changes to the New Books List
program code itself.  Instructions for implementing this 
new feature are included in the INSTALL file.  Alan Keely of
Wake Forest University is responsible for this little gem. 


Wrong Color (bug fix)
-----------

The search form code in newbooks.cgi had an instance where
$inactive_tab_color was assigned as a font color, when the
correct variable should have been $active_font_color.  A
correction has been made.  Thanks to Jeremy Shellhase for 
catching this. 


Location Fragment Spaces (bug fix)
------------------------

Location fragments in newbooks.cgi can now contain spaces.
This had been causing problems for patrons using Netscape 
browsers (IE users were not effected).  William Doering sent
the original alert to this problem.  


inetd.conf Reference (correction)
--------------------

Corrected an erroneous comment in newbooks.pl regarding 
inetd.conf services related to remote copy.


"Can't locate Net/FTP.pm" (bug fix)
-------------------------

The line, "use Net::FTP;" in newbooks.pl has been commented
out with instructions to uncomment it if choosing the FTP
transfer option.  This avoids the "Can't locate Net/FTP.pm"
errors for sites not selecting that option. 


|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version 3.1 CHANGES: new features, improvements, bug fixes |
|------------------------------------------------------------|


WebVoyage Integration (new features)
---------------------

Search form and results pages have the look and feel of the 
WebVoyage 2000.1 search screens.  Credit for the search form
idea is due to Curt Parrish, Internet and Library Systems 
Administrator at Union University.  Curt did it first.

Users can now select how many "records per page" they want.
This not only matches WebVoyage functionality, but it also
reduces page load time for searches that would otherwise have
displayed many hundreds of items.  Users can page forward or
backward to next or previous pages.

Users can now "save search results" similar to the WebVoyage
functionality.  They can select records, retain the selected
records as they page through the results, and email or format
for printing. 

Results pages have a "mini search" form at the top of each page
allowing users to do another search without returning to the 
original page.


Install Instructions (improvement)
--------------------

There is now an INSTALL file with instructions to guide sysadmins
in deploying the programs.


Downloadable Tarball (improvement)
--------------------

No need to cut and paste code from multiple html pages.  All the
code and informational files are available as one easily 
downloadable tarball.


Fewer File Dependencies (improvement)
-----------------------

The cgi-mdd.pl Perl library is no longer needed -- the single 
function required by newbooks.cgi had been moved to that program.

The static newbooks.html page is no longer needed -- the initial 
search form is now generated by the newbooks.cgi program. 


Configuration (improvement)
-------------

All site-specific code has been extracted out of the main body of 
the programs and placed at the top of each file.  This should make
it much easier for non-Perl programmers to install these programs.

In addition, extensive commenting has been added to the configuration
section to help with customization of those programs.


"New Book" SQL Options (improvement)
----------------------

There are now two options for the SQL query that defines what a 
"new book" is.  One is based on Acquisitions related tables, the
other is based on plain-vanilla item records.

Items marked "suppress in opac" are filtered out of list.


File Transfer Options (improvement)
---------------------

There are now three options for transferring the output file from
the SQL query to the desired server/directory.  Sysadmins can FTP,
copy or remote copy the file.


Links to the Catalog (improvement)
--------------------

Now all items are linked back to the catalog, not just the items
with ISBN numbers.  Items without ISBN numbers are linked back
with a title search.


Sorting (improvement/bug fix)
-------

Author sorting now displays items with no author at the bottom
rather than the top of the sort list.

Call number sorting now displays "In Process" (i.e. uncataloged)
items at the bottom rather than the top of the sort list.


Diacritics Cleanup (improvement/bug fix)
------------------

Titles and authors containing MARC "combining" (non-spacing) marks
now have the non-spacing character removed.  Although the intended
diacritic does not appear, the confusing extra character (that was 
never meant to display) is deleted.  This is a good, if not perfect,
solution.  This bug fix also results in more accurate sorting and 
allows title-based links back to the catalog for items that originally
had a MARC combining mark.
