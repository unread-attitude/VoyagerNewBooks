|------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Unix Installation Instructions                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|


Prerequisites
-------------

  Perl must be installed on servers where either newbooks.cgi
  or newbooks.pl will run.  The Perl DBI and DBD::Oracle
  modules must be installed on the server where newbooks.pl  
  will run.  If you choose the FTP option in newbooks.pl, 
  (not required) the Perl Net::FTP module must be installed. 

  Endeavor should have already installed Perl and the DBI/DBD 
  modules on (at least) your Voyager database server.  Use
  the "dope.sh" utility to determine what Perl versions
  you have on your system.

  This version of the New Books List requires that you have
  the Voyager Unicode upgrade.
  

Installation scenarios
----------------------

There are at least four installation scenarios:
  1) Both the extraction program (newbooks.pl) and the
     CGI program (newbooks.cgi) will reside on the same
     server.  This will be the case if your Voyager
     database server and WebVoyage server are one and
     the same. 
  2) The extraction program (newbooks.pl) will reside on
     the Voyager database server, and the CGI program
     (newbooks.cgi) will reside on a separate WebVoyage
     server.  This case is typical for many Voyager sites.
  3) Both the extraction program (newbooks.pl) and the
     CGI program (newbooks.cgi) will reside on a WebVoyage
     server that is _not_ also the Voyager database server.
     This requires installation of the Perl DBI modules on
     the WebVoyage server.  It also requires modifications
     to the DBI connection code in newbooks.pl that are not
     supported in this release.
  4) Both the extraction program (newbooks.pl) and the
     CGI program (newbooks.cgi) will reside on a non-Voyager
     related server.  Like scenario 3, this requires the
     installation of software and configuration changes that 
     are not supported in this release.

     Scenarios 1 or 2 are recommended.  For scenario 3 or 4
     see http://rocky.uta.edu/doran/autolist/faq.html#appserver 


Installation steps 
------------------

  Download newbooks-6.1.tar.gz to your server. 

  Unzip and untar the tarball:

	gzip -d -c newbooks-6.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -

  Note: Using an unzip application *other* than gzip (e.g. WinZip) may
	corrupt the Perl executable scripts.

  The newbooks-6.1.tar.gz tarball should contain the following files:

	./newbooks-6.1/CHANGES
	./newbooks-6.1/INSTALL
	./newbooks-6.1/README.unicode
	./newbooks-6.1/newbooks.pl
	./newbooks-6.1/newbooks.cgi
	./newbooks-6.1/newbooks.ini
	./newbooks-6.1/newbooks.English
	./newbooks-6.1/newbooks.Finnish
	./newbooks-6.1/newbooks.Swedish
	./newbooks-6.1/newbooks.Welsh
	./newbooks-6.1/newbooks.Language

	A document extolling all the wondrous new and improved
	features in this version and previous versions.

	INSTALL (text file)
	This file.

	README.unicode (text file)
	A README file that provides guidance for editing text
	files in a Unicode (UTF-8) environment.

	newbooks.pl (executable program)
	A Perl program that extracts "new books" data from
	the Voyager database and outputs a newbooks.txt file. 

	newbooks.cgi (executable program)
	A CGI/Perl program that displays the initial New Books
	search form, and then displays the results pages from
	user searches.

	newbooks.ini (configuration file)
	This file contains configuration variables that are
	used to customize the newbooks.cgi program.

	newbooks.English/Finnish/Swedish/Welsh (language modules)
	These files provide the language of the user interface.  
	Only one language module is required, but all modules can 
	be utilized if desired.  Note that language module files 
	are also meant to be edited!

	newbooks.Language (language module template)
	This is a template for those who want to create their own
	language module, in order to provide a user interface in a 
	different language than those provided.

	English.gif/Finnish.gif/Swedish.gif/Welsh.gif (flag image files)
	English-alt.gif is an alternate "English" flag using
	the US flag rather than the UK flag.

	newbooks.txt (text file)
	A tab delimited flat-file that you can use to test the 
	functionality of newbooks.cgi.  You will be generating
	your own site-specific newbooks.txt file when you
	configure and run newbooks.pl.

	dope.sh (shell script)
	A utility designed to be run on the command line. It helps
	determine how many instances of Perl are installed on your
	system, what versions they are, and whether or not they
	have the DBI and/or DBD::Oracle modules.

  File ownerships and permissions

	If the files don't untar with the correct ownerships 
	and permissions, please make them look like this: 

	-rwxr--r--   1 voyager  endeavor   ...	newbooks.pl
	-rwxr-xr-x   1 voyager  endeavor   ...	newbooks.cgi
	-rwxr-xr-x   1 voyager  endeavor   ...	newbooks.ini

Testing and configuration steps
-------------------------------

  1) Do a pre-configuration test:
	Before you start configuring the programs, test to see
	if newbooks.cgi works by pointing a web browser to:
	  http://Your_WebVoyage.server.edu/cgi-bin/newbooks.cgi
	It should work "out of the box". (Albeit with the "test" 
	new book data rather than your library's new book data.)
	If it doesn't work, CHECK:
	- FILE OWNERSHIPS AND PERMISSIONS
	- that you have Perl installed (perl -v)
	- that the top line of newbooks.cgi points to a valid 
	  Perl executable
        - run the "dope.sh" utility to find out where Perl is:
	   ./dope.sh
	[Note: links back to the catalog will not work unless
	 your library also owns the item in the test database.]
	If the program works OK, go to step 2.
  2) Generate your own data:
	Read the configuration comments in newbooks.pl and then edit 
	the configurable parts so it will run on your system and
	so that the desired options are specified.  
	Run newbooks.pl (should take approx. 2 to 15+ minutes).
	  ./newbooks.pl
	Debug and repeat as necessary (and re-read the comments!)
	If you get an error message saying "Can't locate DBI.pm" 
	or other DBI:Oracle errors, try changing the top line of 
	the program to an alternate Perl path:
		#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
	  or
		#!/m1/shared/bin/perl -w
          or
		#!/usr/bin/perl -w
	Run the "dope.sh" utility on the command line to determine
	the appropriate paths on your system:
		./dope.sh
	Debug and repeat as necessary.
	Once you have newbooks.pl working, make it a Voyager cron job
        that runs once a day.  See the man pages for cron and crontab 
	and/or consult your favorite Unix sysadmin book for more info.
	(see: http://rocky.uta.edu/doran/scvugm2001/books.html)
        Problems at this stage generally have to do with the transfer
	of the newbooks.txt file rather than with the extraction of
	data from your Voyager database.  If the program produces a
	newbooks.txt file, then you know that that part of the program
	is working.  Configuration of your servers to allow for remote 
	copy is something that I can provide some instructions for, but
	I can't anticipate the many variables in a particular networking 
	environment.  Read the comments in the transfer section of
	newbooks.pl very carefully, and also read the man pages for
	the "rcp" command and the "rhosts" file. 
  3) Customize newbooks.cgi by editing newbooks.ini:
	Read the configuration comments in newbooks.ini and then edit
	the configurable parts to customize for your library.  If you
	chose months instead of weeks in newbooks.pl, you must choose
	the same option in newbooks.ini.
	Use your browser to test newbooks.cgi against your library's 
	new books file (newbooks.txt) that you generated in step 2.
	Debug and repeat as necessary.
	Be sure that you take the time to adjust the colors to match 
	your library's WebVoyage look.  It only takes a few minutes
	and makes a big difference.  :-)
  4) Customize the appropriate language module(s) as needed or desired.
	Note that this step applies to English-only sites, too!
	You can change/edit any and all text that makes up the user
	interface.  Examples include changing the tab text to match
	the tabs in your Webvoyage search screens.  Please read the
	README.unicode help file prior to editing language module files.
	Multilingual sites should examine pathname values in the 
	language modules for accuracy and may also want to refine the
	translations.  It is also possible to add additional languages
	using the language module template (newbooks.Language).
  5) Add a "New Books" tab to all WebVoyage search screens:
        This step requires that you edit the Tab_Text entry
	in the Course_Reserve_Search_Page stanza of the 
	/m1/voyager/xxxdb/etc/webvoyage/local/opac.ini file.
	Replace this:
		Tab_Text=Course Reserves
	With this:
		Tab_Text=Course Reserves</a> &nbsp; </font>&nbsp;
		</th></tr></table></td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
		<td><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
		<tr><th nowrap bgcolor="#8b8989">&nbsp;<font 
		color="#ffffff">&nbsp; <a style="color:#ffffff" 
		href="/cgi-bin/newbooks.cgi">New Books</a>
        IMPORTANT NOTE: There shouldn't be any line breaks in the 
	above code!  That means that all of the Tab_Text value should 
	be one continuous line.  If you cut-and-paste, there will be
	line breaks that have to be removed!  (In vi, use shift-J to
	concatenate lines.)
        You will also have to adjust font, background, and style 
        colors to match your site's scheme.  If your site does not 
	utilize the Course Reserves tab, then of course, you will be 
	apply this to the right-most tab, using the corresponding 
	stanza and making whatever adjustments are appropriate. 
  6) I would really appreciate it, if once you make the New Books 
	List available to your patrons, you would send me the URL so 
	that I can add your institution to the User List.  This is 
	the ONLY thing I ask for in return for using this program.

Free advice
-----------

	As you edit the program files, make sure you regularly make
	backup copies.  That way if some configuration change renders 
	the program unexecutable and you can't figure out how to fix
	it, you can always backtrack to a previous working copy.


Mailing list
------------

	My intention is to eventually maintain a mailing list of 
	contacts for libraries using these programs so that minor news 
	regarding bug fixes, etc., can be sent out without spamming 
	the voyager-l listserv.  While not required, I'd appreciate it 
	if using libraries would provide the email address of a system 
	administrator or other contact person. 


Bug Reports
-----------

	Please report bugs or installation problems to:

	Michael Doran
	email: doran@uta.edu
	telephone: 1.817.272.5326
	telephone: 1.888.565.9023 x25326 (toll-free in U.S.)


Support
-------

	I am a Systems Librarian with a full time job quite apart from 
	creating, enhancing, documenting, distributing, and supporting 
	the New Books List.  Please keep that in mind and thoroughly
	read these installation instructions, the program comments, 
	and the FAQs (http://rocky.uta.edu/doran/autolist/faq.html)
	before contacting me for help.  Considerable effort has gone
	into the documentation, and chances are good that the answer
	to your question is contained there.  

	This is not meant to discourage you from contacting me,
	particularly in regard to bugs or issues that may impact other 
	users of the software.  I am also very interested in hearing 
	how the installation instructions and other documentation can
	be made more clear or otherwise improved.

	Server network configuration to allow for remote copy (rcp)
	of the newbooks.txt file is a separate issue from whether
	the newbooks programs are functioning as designed.  Since 
	rcp configuration occurs in files that have nothing to do
	with the newbooks programs, there are no code changes I can
	make in the newbooks.pl program to magically make rcp work.
	I will only provide assistance for remote copy (rcp) problems
	if you are willing to give me temporary access to your system. 


That's all folks!
-----------------

	Good luck and thanks for choosing the New Books List.  :-)
